# 🧬 Sepsis Mortality Prediction - Stacking Classifier Web App

This Streamlit web application predicts the mortality risk of patients with sepsis using a robust **stacking ensemble classifier** built with machine learning. The goal is to aid clinicians and researchers in identifying high-risk patients quickly and accurately.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://sepsis-mortality-prediction.streamlit.app](https://sepsis-mortality-prediction.streamlit.app)

## 🚀 Features
- Upload CSV files or manually input patient data
- Get instant predictions on mortality risk
- Visualize input data and model output
- Built with `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Streamlit`, and more
- User-friendly interface, mobile-compatible

## 📊 Model Info
This project uses a **stacking classifier** that combines multiple base learners with a meta-model to enhance prediction accuracy. It was trained on medical datasets with features including vitals, lab results, and demographic indicators.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Plotly
- Pillow
